# Mastermind (5 row) for CHIP-8

## Introduction

The 5 row version of mastermind is a game where you can guess 5 numbers from 0 to 7. 
You can try 10 times. 
If both the value and position of the number match, a "dotted bar" is displayed at the bottom, 
and if only the value matches, a "white bar" is displayed at the bottom. 
Please guess the 5 numbers referring to the hint.

## Revisions

### Ver. 2

I also changed the number font of the 5 row mastermind to be a little fashionable. 
You can see that just changing the font will slightly improve the look and feel. 
It is still an important factor in the direction of evolution of video games.

### Ver. 1

I also reprinted the 5 row mastermind in octo assembly language. 
I manually typed in the source of the 5 row mastermind published in a magazine called Viper (Volume 1, Issue 7, pp.22-26). 
In the low resolution mode (64x32), the screen collapsed due to lack of pixels, so I am using the high resolution mode (128x64).
In the 4 row version, the number of figures has increased from 4 to 5, and the number has also increased from 6 (1 to 6) to 8 (0 to 7). 
Enter each numbers with the [X] / [1] / [2] / [3] / [Q] / [W] / [E] / [A] keys. 
Other than that, it is the same as the 4 row version.
