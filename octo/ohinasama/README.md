## Revisions

### Ver. 5

This is the 5th version of drawing Ohinasama with XO-Chip/CHIP-8. 
I changed it to a pixel art style color scheme. 
Since Hinamatsuri is a festival for girls, I mainly use pink. 
The gameboy-style green color didn't suit the Ohinasama. 
The Ohinasama demo is nearing completion.

### Ver. 4

This is the 4th version of drawing Ohinasama with XO-Chip/CHIP-8. 
I drew "Hishimochi" (a symbolic Japanese sweet) and also played "Ureshii Hinamaturi (Happy Doll's Day)" .
The tone can be changed, but I dared to use a square wave to make it look like a chiptune.

### Ver. 3

This is the 3rd version of drawing Ohinasama with XO-Chip/CHIP-8.
I drew "Sanninkanjo" (three official women).
Pixel art is based on the site called [illustAC](https://ac-illust.com/).
Since the sound function is also extended in XO-Chip, I will also try to add BGM.

### Ver. 2

This is the 2nd version of drawing Ohinasama with XO-Chip/CHIP-8.
I drew "Bonbori" (a traditional lighting equipment in Japan) and "Daiza" (a pedestal).
It's becoming more like Ohinasama.
"Kaioui" is a play of drawing pictures in clams and matching them like a memory game.
There is a record of playing in the Heian period (710-1192 A.D.).

### Ver. 1

Since it's about to be "Hinamatsuri" (Doll's Day or Girl's Day),
I tried to draw "Ohinanasama"  (honored dolls and honored palace officials) with XO-Chip/CHIP-8.
It may be the first in the world. 
At the next version, I might try to draw "Sanninkanjo" (three official women).
This also prepare to make a game called "Kaioui".
