# Pong for CHIP-8

## Introduction

It may be about 100 laps behind, but I am also starting to make a new game with CHIP-8. 
I discovered a CHIP-8 development environment called Octo, so I've been playing with it recently. 
First, we are porting pong by notation conversion.
Porting of pong by notation conversion was completed. 
I just changed the assembly language to octo notation. 
I imagine that refactoring will improve the outlook, but I'm tired, so I'll stop here. 
I'm also familiar with the octo notation, so I'll consider the original game.

## How to Play

You can play [in your browser](https://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/index.html?key=jI2EPcN9).

## How to Controll

The player on the left moves the paddle up and down with the [1]/[4] keys.
The player on the right moves the paddle up and down with the [C]/[D] keys.
The key assignment seems to be a little strange.
