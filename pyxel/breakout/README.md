# Breakout for Pyxel/Python

## Introduction

Breakout (Brix hack / 1997) by Mr. David Winter has also been reprinted.
I am using the method of adding labels and comments to codes created by decompilation. 
Furthermore, I tried to convert the codes written in Chip8 assembler language to Pyxel/Python using Grok3.
