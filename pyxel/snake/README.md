# Snake 

## Introduction

It is a famous game where you control a snake and eat food. 
Each time you eat food, the snake grows longer. 
Hustle (1977 / Gremlin) might be the original. 
There was a ported version of NEC's PC-8001.

## Remarks

I also ported [snake](https://github.com/massung/CHIP-8/blob/master/games/sources/snake.c8) to octo assembly language. 
Furthermore, I converted the codes written in octo assembly language into Pyxel/Python using Grok3(beta).
