I ported [Simple physics engine](https://thinkit.co.jp/article/8466) implemented in JavaScript to Pyxel/Python.

### How to Run

Please execute the following from the Pyxel (version 1.9.18) environment.

### Pachinko

I also ported the Pachinko game that was introduced 
in [the original book](https://book.impress.co.jp/books/1122101041) to Pyxel/Python,
and changed to a retro color tone.
Flick a pachinko ball and hit the bar below to get 10 points.
