# Lunar Lander for Pyxel/Python

## Introduction

[Lunar Lander](https://github.com/massung/CHIP-8/blob/master/games/sources/lander.c8) (Jeffrey Massung / 2017) was also reprinted in octo assembly language.
Furthermore, I tried to convert the codes written in Chip8 assembler language to Pyxel/Python using Grok3.

This is a game where you operate a lunar module and land on the moon. 
Lunar Lander (Atari / 1979) is a famous implementation, 
but the Apollo program's lunar lander simulator seems to be the original.
